# Policy Management and Enforcement Application (PMEA)

PMEA is a Python-based application designed to facilitate the management and enforcement of company policies within an organization. It allows the creation, distribution, acknowledgment tracking, and reporting of policies.

## Features

### Policy Management
- **Create Policy**: Easily create new policies with associated approval workflows.
- **Policy Versioning**: Policies are versioned for easy tracking of changes.

### User Management
- **User Representation**: Users within the organization are represented with their respective IDs, names, and departments.
- **Policy Acknowledgment**: Users can acknowledge policies, indicating their understanding and agreement.

### Policy Distribution
- **Distribute Policy**: Policies can be distributed to specific users or groups within the organization.

### Compliance Reporting
- **Generate Report**: Generate reports on policy compliance status within the organization.

## Usage

1. **Create Policy**: Use the `create_policy` method of the PMEA instance to create a new policy. Provide the policy name, content, and approval workflow as parameters.

2. **Distribute Policy**: Distribute the created policy using the `distribute_policy` method, specifying the policy and the list of users to whom it should be distributed.

3. **User Acknowledgment**: Track user acknowledgment of policies by using the `track_acknowledgment` method, providing the user and the policy as parameters.

4. **Generate Report**: Generate a compliance report using the `generate_report` method. This feature is currently a placeholder for future implementation.
